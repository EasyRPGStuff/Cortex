As a solo gamer (in addition to playing with a group), I'm always looking for oracles that fit fairly seamlessly with the core game mechanics. I'm messing around with such an Oracle for Cortex Prime, based on the core Test mechanics.

If you're not familiar with solo play or such oracles, basically any time you would ask a GM a question, you instead ask an "oracle", which is a dice mechanic that provides some kind of Yes or No answer (often with some kind of modifiers or intensifiers). There are many published materials out there that do this in various ways, but they can sometimes feel out of place with the mechanics of the system you're playing. For example, the Mythic GM Emulator uses percentile rolls, which don't really mesh with Cortex's mechanics. The transition can be a little jarring sometimes. So I often look for ways to use a game's core mechanics to do this.

# The Mod - "Oracle Tests"

* Ask a yes-or-no question.
* Roll 3d8 for the "Oracle" roll to set the difficulty. This is much like a GMC roll, or the GM rolling to set a difficulty. 
  * If a "Yes" seems more likely, roll 3d6 instead of 3d8 for the Oracle roll. You may even decide on 3d4 if something is extremely likely.
  * If a "No" seems more likely, roll 3d10 (or even 3d12 if extremely unlikely) instead of 3d8 for the Oracle roll.
* Then roll 3d8 for the Player (treat this as a PC rolling) and try to beat the number set by the Oracle, just as in any other Test. 
* **A success indicates a Yes result, while a failure indicates a No result.**
* If the Oracle rolled a hitch, there is an additional positive modifier to the Yes or No answer (a "No" result becomes "No, but...", or a "Yes" result becomes "Yes, and..").
* Conversely, if the Player Question rolled a hitch, there is an additional negative modifier to the Yes or No answer ("Yes" becomes "Yes, but..." or "No" becomes "No, and...").
* Hitches for both the Oracle and the Player Question cancel each other out one-for-one.
* This gives a full range of results:
  * "No, and..."
  * "No"
  * "No, but..."
  * "Yes, but..."
  * "Yes"
  * "Yes, and..."
* If it seems appropriate, any hitch may add a Scene Distinction, or an appropriate Asset or Complication.
* OPTION: If using the Doom Pool mod for the game, roll against the Doom Pool (or a subset of its dice) for the Oracle roll, as with any other test in a game that uses the Doom Pool.

# Example 1
The PC, a paranormal investigator, is investigating an allegedly haunted house. Not coming up with much on the first floor, the player asks "Is there a basement?" 

It's been previously established that this is taking place in the countryside in New England. Basements would be relatively common, so it's determined that this is likely, so the player rolls 3d6 for the Oracle roll, getting `1 6 4`, a 10 with a hitch. Rolling 3d8 to try to beat it, The player gets `8 3 7`, or a 15 for a success. This is a "Yes" result, and due to the hitch rolled by the Oracle, there is an even more positive result ("Yes, and..."). The player determines that this means that not only is there a basement, but a valuable clue is there as well. As a heroic success on top of it, it's likely a *very* valuable clue.

# Example 2
The player is the captain of a tramp freighter working in the Delta Quadrant. He has a load of raw materials that he's bringing to his next port of call. He asks, "is there significant demand for my cargo?" 

This is decided to be neither likely nor unlikely, so the Oracle will roll the default 3d8. The Oracle roll is `2 7 6` for a 13. The PC Question roll comes back `2 1 7`, for a 9, which fails, and the hitch is an additional negative. Demand is low, and additionally, maybe there is an recent embargo on the materials' port of origin, or the cargo is recently declared contraband here. The player decides to add a d6 complication of "Carrying Contraband" until he can either get rid of the cargo or get out of this system.

# Example 3
The player has encountered an intelligent new species. He asks if the species is friendly. The Oracle roll comes up `7 7 2` for a 14. The PC roll (defaulting to 3d8 again) is `4 8 5` for 13, which fails and is a simple "No" since no hitches were rolled by either. 

The species may not be overtly hostile (yet), but they are certainly very guarded and not at all receptive. Best to not make any accidental social faux pas, or things might become hostile...

# Notes
I thought about rolling against a static difficulty number instead of having two dice rolls, but that causes us to lose out on the dimension of having the Oracle roll a hitch for additional positive effect.

I'm open to suggestions on how to improve on this as well.
