# Cortex RPG Hacks

This repo consists of some of my hacks for the Cortex Prime roleplaying game system. This is a tabletop RPG project, not a coding project. The "source" is the product. These docs for each hack will be made available in markdown, HTML, and PDF formats. This is because I write these in a markdown editor, and my MD editor of choice (plug for [Joplin](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin)) exports to these formats natively. They're fairly universal formats that everyone should be able to read regardless of platform.

The Cortex Prime Game Handbook (CPGH) is required to play any of these games. I make frequent reference to pages in this book rather than re-write what has been written. This is because I am lazy, and because Dire Wolf Digital owns the game system. You can purchase the CPGH at Dire Wolf Digital's [online store](https://shop.direwolfdigital.com/collections/rpg). **I am not affiliated with Dire Wolf Digital or any other rights holder.** 

Setting information for these games is limited at this time, players are expected to research or create their own setting info. This is half because I am lazy, half because I have no desire to get in hot water with anyone's IP, and half because RPG players are imaginative people who can do this on their own. Yes, that's three halves.

If you have a brilliant idea to improve on this stuff, feel free to sumbit a pull request and I'll give it all due consideration. I'll likely commit new hacks from time to time, as I have some works in progress.

# Cthulhu Prime
A Cortex Prime hack for playing games of cosmic horror in the style of the stories of H.P. Lovecraft et. al. It's a fairly minimal hack using a lot of stock options from the CPGH. This is intentional... I felt that a lot of the stock options worked really well, and little custom rule creation was needed.

# Cortex Prime Directive
A Cortex Prime hack for playing games in the universe of the Star Trek (or similar setting). Includes ship and ship combat rules that I hope capture the feel of the source material.

# The Antediluvian Age
A Cortex Prime hack for playing games of "sword & scorcery" adventures in a lost era millenia before the Great Deluge, when great civilizations spanned the lost continents of Atlantis, Lemuria, and Mu, and strange, now-extinct creatures walked the land. This hack focuses on somewhat antiheroic escapades of the sort one would expect from the likes of Conan, Fafhrd and Grey Mouser, and so on. Characters are pushed by their Drives... similar to Values from the CPGH, but generally more vice than virtue. Sorcery comes at a price, and is generally the domain of antagonists. The magic system is freeform and somewhat of a work in progress.

This may get some setting info beyond the rough sketch above... some day.
