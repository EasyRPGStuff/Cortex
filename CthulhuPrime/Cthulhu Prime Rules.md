# Traits
Traits will be pretty limited in order to keep dice pools low, and emulate how difficult it is facing the challneges of the genre. 
* The default **Skills** list from the Cortex Prime Game Handbook (p57) will be used as one Prime Set. This represents the generally fairly specialized focuses of protagonists in the genre, and is a nod to the *Call of Cthulhu* system as well.
	* We won't use Highlights for Distinctions in this so we'll give 15 points to step up skills in character generation.
* The second Prime Set will be **Values** (p60), because the protagonosts in Lovecraftian fiction often find themselves drawn into their situation by their drives. 
	* The **Duty, Gloty, Justice, Love, Power, Truth** set from p60 will do well here.
	* Take one Value at d10, one at d8, one at d4, the rest at d6.
	* Values will have **Trait Statements**, at least for the top one or two initially. Feel free to fill in others in play.
	
* Distinctions as usual.

That's it for traits.

# Gameplay Mods
* **Doom Pool** (p32) and **Crisis Pools** (p33) are genre appropriate. 
* **Stress** and **Trauma** are also good genre emulation. I also like **Pushing Stress** for this one. The stress tracks are:
	* Afraid
	* Fatigued
	* Horrified
	* Inujured

The difference between Afraid and Horrified reqires a short discussion. **Afraid** is what you feel when you are immediately in fear for your personal safety, such as being chased by cultusts, standing on a thin ledge above a bottomless chasm, etc. **Horrfied** is what you feel when you are overwhelmed by Things Man was not meant to know, a growing understanding of humanity's place in the universe as basically ants, your mind is overwhelmed by the psychic of trauma of interacting with Great Old Ones, and so on.

Characters overwhelmed by Afraid stress may flee the scene, and trauma may indicate acute stress reaction or even PTSD. Characters overwhelmed by Horrified by be shocked into unresponsiveness, and trauma may lead to catatonia or worse.

# THAT'S IT!
